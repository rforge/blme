	* blme now ignores the common scale when penalizing the random effect covariance. In previous versions it multiplied it in but didn't take the prior into account when profiling it out - in essence failing to correspond to a probabilistic model. The next version will allow the prior to be on the scale-free covariance, or on the real-world covariance matrix. For now, just the scale-free version. ** This means the fitted models will be different than previous versions. **
	* Reduced the default shape for random-effect covariance posteriors on the variance scale so that the polynomial term has an exponent of 1 in the univariate case. The multivariate now has df of dim + 1 to correspond.
	* Fixed a few typos in the documentation.
	* Cleaned up imports from NAMESPACE file.
	* Replaced a .Internal call.

	* Fixed off-by one bug on termination of the optimization loop which caused gradient evaluation steps to be reported a the maximum.
	* REML optimization for sigma with a fixef prior was slightly off.
	* sigma now accepts inverse gamma priors (improper, as well).
	* Internal version of sim().

        * Prevented summary from printing misc. lines when only one covariance prior is implemented. Gaussian fixed effects priors summarize in terms of their covariance correctly when the covariance is diagonal or a scalar times the identity.

        * Fixed a bug related to the scaling of priors to the data in the presence of interactions.
        * Added point priors on the common scale, enabling meta-analyses.
