With the update of lme4 to version 1.0 and the change of interals from BLAS/LAPACK to Eigen, blme has undergone a complete rewrite.

Major changes:
  Use of quotations around priors no longer necessary
  No long automatically rescales priors to data. Rescaling your inputs is probably best policy

Minor changes:
  var.prior argument renamed to resid.prior
  Can place priors on the square root of the random effect covariance
  
Previously, blme essentially reimplemented lme4 but with priors. The new version uses as much lme4 machinery as possible, with a few downstream impacts. Particularly:
  Different optimizer means occasionally different results. Also can be a little slower
  glmms now fit with adaptive Gaussian quadrature for greater accuracy


Versioning
==========
The main branch of blme will go forward and depend on lme4 version 1.0. A legacy branch will also be provided on R-forge that is compatible with "lme4.0", called blme.0. This info applies until lme4 version 1.0 makes its way to CRAN, at which point using the latest versions should be hassle-free.

Finally, a compatibility build is available until the CRAN situation has been resolved. It is named "blme" and depends on lme4 for verions less than 1.

Installation
============
To install the latest versions:
  1) Install lme4 v1.0
    1.0) Install appropriate developer tools for your platform. Consult http://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html
    1.1) Install devtools package
    1.2) Within R, execute
      require("devtools"); install_github("lme4", user = "lme4", ref = "release")
  2) Install blme v0.2
    2.1) Within R, execute
      install.packages("blme", repos = "http://R-Forge.R-project.org")

To install legacy versions
  1) Install lme4.0
    1.1) Within R, execute
      install.packages("lme4.0", repos = "http://R-Forge.R-project.org", type = "source")
  2) Install blme.0
