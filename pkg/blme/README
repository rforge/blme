With the update of lme4 to version 1.0 and the change of interals from BLAS/LAPACK to Eigen, blme has undergone a complete rewrite.

Major changes:
  Use of quotations around priors no longer necessary
  No long automatically rescales priors to data. Rescaling your inputs is probably best policy

Minor changes:
  var.prior argument renamed to resid.prior
  Can place priors on the square root of the random effect covariance
  
Previously, blme essentially reimplemented lme4 but with priors. The new version uses as much lme4 machinery as possible, with a few downstream impacts. Particularly:
  Different optimizer means occasionally different results. Also can be a little slower
  glmms now fit with adaptive Gaussian quadrature for greater accuracy


Versioning
==========
The main branch of blme will go forward and depend on lme4 version 1.0. A legacy branch will also be provided on R-forge that is compatible with "lme4.0", called blme.0. This info applies until lme4 version 1.0 makes its way to CRAN, at which point using the latest versions should be hassle-free.

Finally, a legacy build is available until the CRAN situation has been resolved. It is named "blme" and depends on lme4 for versions less than 1.

Installation
============
To install the latest versions:
  1) Install lme4 v1.0 or greater
    1.0) Within R, execute
      install.packages("lme4")
  2) Install blme v1.0 or greater
    2.1) Within R, execute
      install.packages("blme")

To install legacy versions
  0) Install appropriate developer tools for your platform. Consult http://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html
  1) Install lme4.0
    1.1) Within R, execute
      install.packages("lme4.0", repos = "http://R-Forge.R-project.org", type = "source")
  2) Install blme.0
    2.1) Within R, execute
      install.packages("blme.0", repos = "http://R-Forge.R-project.org", type = "source")

To install the legacy package
  1) Install lme4 version, less than 1 (on CRAN)
  2) Install blme legacy
    2.1) Checkout blme legacy source by executing from a command line:
      svn co svn://svn.R-Forge.R-project.org/svnroot/blme/legacy/blme
    2.2) Within R, execute
      install.packages("path/to/blme", repos = NULL, type = "source")
